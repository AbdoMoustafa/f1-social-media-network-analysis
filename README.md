## Project Overview

This project conducts a comprehensive network analysis of Formula 1 social media interactions using data from Twitter. It explores various types of networks to uncover patterns and insights in the Formula 1 online community.

## Networks Analyzed

1. Follower Network
2. Reply Network
3. Mention Network
4. User-Hashtag Bipartite Network
5. Hashtag Co-occurrence Network

## Key Analyses

- Network visualization
- Basic network statistics (nodes, edges, density)
- Centrality measures (degree, betweenness, closeness, eigenvector)
- Weight distribution in weighted networks
- Ego-centric analysis of important nodes

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Python
- Networkx
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
- Gephi (for advanced visualization)

## Key Findings

- Official Formula 1 accounts and top drivers play central roles in the network structure
- Significant differences exist in network characteristics between follower, reply, and mention networks
- Insights into hashtag usage patterns reveal trends in Formula 1 social media discourse
